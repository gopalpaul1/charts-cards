# Charts Cards

## Charts
* Chart Type: The choice of chart (bar, line, pie, etc.) depends on the data and the story you want to convey.

* Color and Style: Consistent use of colors and styles ensures clarity and coherence, making it easier for viewers to interpret the chart.

* Scale and Units: Clearly defined scales and units on the axes are crucial for accurate interpretation and comparison of data.

### RadialBarChart

Radial Bar Charts visually represent data in a circular format, using bars extending from a central point. Key features include displaying multivariate data, emphasizing proportions, and providing a compact overview of information. They are effective for showcasing relationships and patterns within datasets, making them valuable for data visualization and analysis.
